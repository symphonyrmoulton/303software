#303 Software Exercise

--This is what I got done in 1 hour, I realize it isn't code complete, the tests aren't finished and passing, and there are some things that were asked in the test I didn't have time to get everything done.

--To run install node modules and npm start. the "seed" is automatic and will insert only 1 row, i didn't have time to separate it out into its own script yet. The api end points are mostly working. Its mostly done, I was just told it was timed and so I thought I'd submit what I got done in an hour.
